# SpeechCalc
A voice enabled calculator

You need a python enabled device, a microphone connected to it, and an arduino

Connect the arduino to a lcd display

Import pySerial and SpeechRecognition

When you run the Python file, make sure you wait a second after "Speak:" appears so it can initalize.
Also change the line "ser.port = COM5" to whatever port your board is on.
